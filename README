## UCFK4 Pong Game

### About

This project was written as part of a University Of Canterbury Course.
It is an embedded C project, aimed to run on the UCFK4.
This was my first taste of writing a embedded system project in C, a lot was learnt during the proccess.
I have since improved vastly, so don't judge too harshly.

### How to play Pong

To start both players need to push the nav switch down.
Move the nav switch North and South to move the paddle.
Stop the ball from getting beside the paddle.
If the ball hits the middle of the paddle it will head straight
If the ball hits the left or right sides of the paddle it will 
move on an angle away from the paddle. 
A 'W' will apear if you win a 'L' will appear if you lose.
After this, the starting screen will show again, you are then able to repeatly play.
